# Water Temperature Sensor 😁❄🔥
The Keyestudio water temperature sensor is a small electronic thermometer that turns temperature into the arduino can read. It works by changing its electrical behavior when the water gets hotter or colder. The board converts that into a temperature value like degrees Celsius. The metal tube keeps the electronics dry but lets heat from the water reach the chip very quickly, so it reacts fast when the temperature changes.

# How it senses temperature
Inside the sensor, the DS18B20 chip measures temperature using materials that electrical properties change with heat. The chip then turns that measurement into a digital signal, so instead of a random small voltage, it sends an exact temperature value over a data line.
